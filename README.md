Introduction to Github

Hello All, 

I'm excited to start using Github and continue my programming journey. There's so much to learn out there that I want to learn as effictively as possible. To that end, I want to focus on project-based learning and first principles, and building my ability to break down complex problems and finding creative solutions.
